## Description
"The Dog Gallery" is a simple yet responsive web application designed to showcase various dog breeds and allow users to interact with dog images. Users can browse a dynamic gallery of dog images, search for specific breeds, and manage a list of their favorite dog pictures. The application uses The Dog API for all its content and data persistence.

## Features
* **Dynamic Dog Image Gallery:** Displays a collection of random dog images upon page load.
* **Breed Search Functionality:** Users can search for dog images by entering a specific breed name. The application fetches and displays images related to the searched breed.
* **Favorites Management:**
    * **Add to Favorites:** Users can mark any image in the main gallery as a favorite using a dedicated button.
    * **View Favorites:** A separate section displays all images the user has favorited.
    * **Remove from Favorites:** Users can remove images from their favorites list.
    * **Persistence:** Favorited images persist when the page reloads since they are stored via The Dog API.
* **Basic Pagination:** Allows browsing through multiple pages of dog images in the main gallery.
* **Responsive Design:** Basic styling ensures a decent viewing experience across different device sizes.
* **User Feedback:** Provides clear messages for loading states, successful operations, and errors.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3:** For styling and presentation, ensuring an engaging user experience.
* **JavaScript (ES Modules):**
    * **Fetch API:** Used for all asynchronous HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE) to communicate with The Dog API.
    * **Promises & Async/Await:** Implemented throughout the application to manage asynchronous operations effectively, improving code readability and preventing issues like race conditions and out-of-order API calls.
    * **ES Modules:** Code is organized into modular files for better maintainability, reusability, and separation of concerns.

* **[The Dog API](https://thedogapi.com):** The external web API used to fetch dog images and manage user favorites.

## API Key Setup
To run this application, you need an API key from The Dog API.

1.  Go to [https://thedogapi.com/](https://thedogapi.com/).
2.  Click 'GET YOUR API KEY'
3.  Click 'GET FREE ACCESS'
4.  Fill out the form and click 'SUBMIT'
2.  Check your email for your unique API key.
3.  Open `js/api.js` in your project.
4.  Replace `'YOUR_DOG_API_KEY'` with your actual API key:

    ```javascript
    // js/api.js
    const API_KEY = 'YOUR_DOG_API_KEY_HERE';
    ```
    (Note: In a production environment, API keys should ideally be stored and managed on a backend server to prevent client-side exposure.)

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd dog-app
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository if you're hosting it.)

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    Follow the instructions in the [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup) section above.

3.  **Open the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No local server is strictly required for basic functionality, but using a development server (like Live Server extension in VS Code) is recommended for better development experience.

## Project Structure
The JavaScript code is organized into three main modules:

* `index.html`: Defines the structure of the web application.
* `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the application.
* `js/`:
    * `app.js`: The main application logic. It orchestrates interactions between the UI and the API, handling user input and updating the display.
    * `api.js`: Dedicated to handling all communications with The Dog API (making requests, managing endpoints and API keys).
    * `ui.js`: Responsible for all DOM manipulation and rendering, providing functions to display images, show messages, and manage loading states.

This modular approach ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Asynchronous JavaScript & Event Loop
The application relies heavily on `async/await` syntax-built on Promises-to manage asynchronous operations like fetching data from The Dog API. This ensures:

* **Non-blocking UI:** API calls and other long-running tasks do not freeze the user interface, providing a smooth user experience.
* **Orderly Execution:** `await` ensures that subsequent code execution pauses until a Promise resolves, preventing race conditions where data might be processed before it's fully received. This is crucial for tasks like fetching breed lists before searching for a specific breed ID.
* **Readability:** The `async/await` syntax makes asynchronous code appear more synchronous, making it easier to read and think through.
